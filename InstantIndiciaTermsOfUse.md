# Registration Terms of Use #

If you need to impose terms & conditions of usage of the site on your users, then the Registration Terms of Use feature is for you. It extends the existing registration page with a new panel containing terms and conditions text which the user must acknowledge before they can register. For example, you might like to state that any data contributed to the site is to be made available for public access.

Here's a screenshot of the Registration Terms of Use feature in operation:

If you need to configure the text, then the page you need to edit can be found at the path _terms\_of\_use_, e.g. http://www.example.com/terms_of_use or http://www.example.com/?q=terms_of_use if you are not using readable URLs. You can also configure the other labels used by navigating to _Site Configuration >> Terms of Use_ on the admin menu.
