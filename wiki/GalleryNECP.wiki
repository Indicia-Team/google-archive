#summary About the North East Cetacean Project

== North East Cetacean Project ==

The North East Cetacean Project (NECP) is an initiative which aims to generate up-to-date information on the status of cetaceans (the collective name for dolphins and whales) off the Northumberland coastline and beyond. By providing a user friendly means of entering ad-hoc sighting data, boat skippers, volunteers and professionals are able to make valuable contributions to this project.

The site is built using Drupal and the IForms Indicia integration module. The data entry form is available in the prebuilt forms library (ad_hoc_cetaceans) and it uses the my_dot_map form to generate a distribution map on final record submission.
