#summary Information on calling the Data Services

= Introduction =

Indicia's Data Services provide a programmatic interface to information held in the Indicia core database. The Data Services are a RESTful web service, with each entity represented by a URL.

== Constructing the service URL ==

The Data Services are accessed via the URL of the site root + /index.php/services/data/ + the name of the required data entity, which is the singular version of the required table name, for example `http://www.mysite.com/index.php/services/data/termlist`

== Retrieving a single item of data ==

To retrieve a single item of data with a known id, append a forward slash then the item's id to the URL, for example `http://www.mysite.com/index.php/services/data/termlist/3` will retrieve the termlist with id 3.

== Retrieving a list of data ==

Retrieving a list of data can be achieved by ommitting the id from the URL. In this case, a number of GET parameters are available to control the output as follows:

||filter||||
||filter_field||||
||orderby||||
||sortdir||||
||limit||||
||offset||||

== Output Mode ==

Calls to the URLs normally return a formatted XML document describing the results. This can be overridden by providing a GET parameter called mode in the URL to request json or csv data. Other formats can be supported by adding views that generate the formatted output to the modules/indicia_svc_data/views/services/data/_entity name_ folder. 

== Attaching XSL to XML output ==

By passing a GET parameter called xsl to the URL, an XSL transformation can be linked to by the returned XML document. Either a fully qualified path to the XSL document is required, or if just a file name is given then the XSL document must exist in the folder \media\services\stylesheets within the website root. An example file called default.xsl is provided. For example `http://www.mysite.com/index.php/services/data/termlist?xsl=default.xsl` retrieves the XML document listing all termlists into the browser and formats it on the client using the XSL file to appear as an HTML table.
