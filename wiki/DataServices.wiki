#summary Information on calling the Data Services

= Introduction =

Indicia's Data Services provide a programmatic interface to information held in the Indicia core database. The Data Services are a RESTful web service, with each entity represented by a URL.

== Constructing the service URL ==

The Data Services are accessed via the URL of the site root + /index.php/services/data/ + the name of the required data entity, which is the singular version of the required table name, for example:
`http://www.mysite.com/index.php/services/data/termlist`

== Retrieving a single item of data ==
To retrieve a single item of data with a known id, append a forward slash then the item's id to the URL, for example: {{{http://www.mysite.com/index.php/services/data/termlist}}}

== Retrieving a list of data ==

== Output Mode ==

Calls to the URLs normally return a formatted XML document describing the results. This can be overridden by providing a query string in the URL to request json or csv data. Other formats can be supported by adding views that generate the formatted output to the modules/indicia_svc_data/views/services/data/_entity name_ folder.
