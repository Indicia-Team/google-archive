This from has the following features:
  * Uses a report to populate a list of records. 
  * You can override the report used and the columns displayed in the Edit view for the page.
  * Each row clearly shows the current status.
  * Clicking on a row selects the row and shows a tabbed panel containing full record details, a map, any images and comments. 
  * Buttons are available for rejecting or verifying records as well as emailing full details to an expert for checking.
  * Verifying or rejecting a record requests a comment to be added explaining why.
  * The Comments tab allows new comments to be added.

When using this form, you might want to consider ticking the View Access Control checkbox on the Edit page (under the Other IForm Parameters section) and possibly specifying a permission name, to allow you to control who has access to the verification facilities:

Note that if you are using the Verification feature in Instant Indicia, then the permissions are automatically set up for you.
