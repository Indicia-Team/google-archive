== Database Upgrade Scripts ==

For each upgrade to the datamodel, a script is added to the trunk\application\db folder in SubVersion. The script makes the required alteration to the database and is saved as a file named using the following convention:

*yyyymmddhhmm_description_of_change.sql*

This way scripts can easily be sorted chronologically and applied in sequence.
