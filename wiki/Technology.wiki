#summary A brief summary of the development technologies used in the Indicia Core Module.

= Technology =

== PostgreSQL and PostGIS ==

[http://www.postgresql.org/ PostgreSQL] is a true Open Source database widely acknowledged as a rival to other well known commercial options, both in terms of speed and power. It is the ideal choice for Indicia because of the free [http://postgis.refractions.net/ PostGIS] extension which converts PostgreSQL into a powerful spatially enabled database. This optimises the data for storing spatial data such as location boundaries and species records and also provides in-built support for questions such as "tell me which records are within the boundary of this location".

== PHP ==

The language used for the Core Module development is PHP, selected mainly for its ubiquitous nature and therefore easy of finding developers, getting support and hosting.

== Kohana ==

[http://kohanaphp.com/home Kohana] is a framework which effectively provides a ready made layout for a PHP web application. It structures the application using a pattern known as [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model-view-controller Model View Controller] and also provides lots of built in libraries and extensions to make day to day development tasks easier. 

== JQuery ==

[http://jquery.com/ JQuery] is a powerful !JavaScript library that simplifies the task of writing powerful client side code which runs within the web browser, for example to provide animations and facilitate [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AJAX AJAX] interactions.

== OpenLayers ==
[http://openlayers.org/ OpenLayers] is an Open Source tool for adding dynamic maps to web pages.
