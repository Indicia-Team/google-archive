*How much does Indicia cost*

Indicia is Open Source software and there are no costs for the software itself. However, before implementing a project using Indicia please take into account the cost of web-hosting and also developing your Indicia powered site, although the latter should be considerably cheaper using Indicia than if starting from scratch.

*Is Indicia ready for me to use now?*

Well, Indicia is now functional and can indeed be used to build online recording websites. However, it is still early days for the project so if you adopt Indicia right now you will probably find some bugs and areas of functionality that could do with improving. Hopefully nothing that will prevent you from developing your site though. 

*How do I report a bug?*

First, you need to have a Google account. Once you have that set up, go to [http://code.google.com/p/indicia/issues/list] and click the New Issue link near the top. Please take care to fill in all the details you can about how to reproduce the bug.

== Installation Requirements ==

*Indicia requires PostgreSQL to run - our Hosting only offers support for MySQL, is there any way of running Indicia under MySQL?*

In order to install Indicia, you need 2 things. The first is a "Warehouse" which hosts the back-end stuff, including PostgreSQL and preferably [http://geoserver.org GeoServer] (which uses Java so also may be difficult for your host). The intention is that a single Warehouse can support several online recording websites, and therefore it may not be necessary to host your own as you can share it with other schemes. For example, there is a possibility that a national record centre might host a Warehouse for use by other organisations. Or alternatively several record centres could combine forces and share a Warehouse between them. Because of the technology required, although it is possible to find a shared internet account which will allow installation, the Warehouse is more likely to be installed on a private server of some kind.

The second thing you need is the website itself which will include your data capture pages, and maybe distribution maps, browsing and reports etc. These pages only require PHP version 5.2 or higher to run, in fact it is possible to get them working with any web technology although you will need to put in more effort as the examples are all PHP. So, you will be able to host your actual website pages on most shared accounts without problems.

Your webserver must not be blocked from accessing the Warehouse server by a firewall to allow communications between the 2 servers.

The other thing to bear in mind is that although Indicia currently runs on PostgreSQL, the technology is mostly platform independent so ought to work on MySQL as well. The only caveat to this is the use of spatial reference transformations which MySQL does not support. This means that if it needs to run on MySQL, we would need to change the code to use a different method of spatial reference transformation, plus retest it, but it would not need a rewrite.
