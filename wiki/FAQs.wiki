*Is Indicia ready for me to use now?*

Well, Indicia is now functional and can indeed be used to build online recording websites. However, it is still early days for the project so if you adopt Indicia right now you will probably find some bugs and areas of functionality that could do with improving. Hopefully nothing that will prevent you from developing your site though. 

== Installation Requirements ==

*Indicia requires PostgreSQL to run - our Hosting only offers support for MySQL, is there any way of running Indicia under MySQL?*

In order to install Indicia, you need 2 things. The first is a "Core Server" which hosts the back-end stuff, including PostgreSQL and preferably [http://geoserver.org GeoServer] (which uses Java so also may be difficult for your host). The intention is that a single Core Server can support several online recording websites, and therefore it may not be necessary to host your own as you can share it with other schemes. For example, there is a possibility that a national record centre might host a Core Server for use by other organisations. Or alternatively several record centres could combine forces and share a Core Server between them. Because of the technology required, although it is possible to find a shared internet account which will allow installation, the Core Server is more likely to be installed on a private server of some kind.

The second thing you need is the website itself which will include your data capture pages, and maybe distribution maps, browsing and reports etc. These pages only require PHP to run, in fact it is possible to get them working with any web technology although you will need to put in more effort as the examples are all PHP. So, you will be able to host your actual website pages on any shared account without problems.

The other thing to bear in mind is that although Indicia currently runs on PostgreSQL, the technology is mostly platform independent so ought to work on MySQL as well. The only caveat to this is the use of spatial reference transformations which MySQL does not support. This means that if it needs to run on MySQL, we would need to change the code to use a different method of spatial reference transformation, plus retest it, but it would not need a rewrite.
