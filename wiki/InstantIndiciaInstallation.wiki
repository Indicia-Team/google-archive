#summary An overview of Instant Indicia

= Introduction =

Put simply, Instant Indicia provides the fastest and simplest way of setting up an Indicia powered online recording website.

So, how does it do that? Instant Indicia provides you with 
  * a customised installer for the [DrupalIntroduction Drupal content management system]
  * a selection of ready-made [InstantIndiciaFeatures features] you can add to your site with minimal configuration.

= When should I use Instant Indicia? =

If you are setting up a new website are happy to base this on the Drupal content management system then use Instant Indicia. Even if you decide not to use the provided features (such as ready-made data input forms and reports) Instant Indicia still simplifies the process of setting up the modules your website is likely to require.

Note that Instant Indicia simplifies the initial setup but does not hinder your further development of the website. You still have full access to the flexibility of customisation available to a normal Indicia website.

If you are integrating Indicia into an existing website, or need to use a technology other than Drupal, then Instant Indicia cannot help.
