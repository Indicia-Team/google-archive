The Verification feature provides a quick and easy way to review, verify, reject, email details of and comment on incoming records.

This feature is based on the [PrebuiltFormVerification3 Verification 3] form which describes the features available. When using this feature, note that you must assign any users who you want to have access to the feature to the Verifier permission in Drupal. 

The feature creates a menu item called Verification which is only visible to users with the required permissions.
