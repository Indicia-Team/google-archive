#summary A description of how to release a version of Indicia.

= Preparing a release of Indicia =

1.	Edit the application/config/version.php file and set the version, release_date and repository settings. For example:
{{{
$config['version'] = '0.6.1';
$config['release_date']  = '2011-04-19';
$config['repository'] = 'https://indicia.googlecode.com/svn/core/tags/version 0.6.1';
}}}

2.	Ensure that there is a folder in the setup matching the version you have created in indicia\modules\indicia_setup\db, _even if there are no database scripts to release_. Commit the changes to version.php and the new folder to the SVN repository.

3.	Update your indicia SVN checkout folder to the latest (HEAD) version from the repository.

4.	Use the SVN export facility to create an export of https://indicia.googlecode.com/svn/core/trunk into a local temporary folder. To do this I normally use the TortoiseSVN Export option available when right clicking on my updated indicia SVN checkout folder.

5.	At this stage it’s a good idea to try copying the indicia export folder into a webserver folder and installing it to check nothing major is broken. Note this step should become unnecessary when continuous integration testing is operational.

6.	Zip the indicia folder created.

7.	Rename the zip file to indicia-x.x.x.zip replacing the x’s with the version number.

8.	Upload the file to the Downloads page on Google code http://code.google.com/p/indicia/downloads/list and deprecate all previous versions of the file by replacing the Featured label on the file with Deprecated. Label the upload Type-Installer, OpSys-All and Featured.

9.	In the Subversion repository, create a folder for the version called “version x.x.x” under https://indicia.googlecode.com/svn/core/tags and copy the contents of https://indicia.googlecode.com/svn/core/trunk into it. 

10.	Download a copy of the previous version of the Client Helpers folder. 

11.	Unzip this download and find the helper_config.php file. Copy it to the client_helpers folder in your exported indicia/client_helpers folder (in my example this is c:\localsource\indicia\client_helpers).
 
12.	Zip the indicia/client_helpers folder containing this copied across file and rename the resulting zip file to client_helpers-x.x.x.zip. This file can then be uploaded to the Downloads page as before setting the labels to Featured and OpSys-All. Finally deprecate the previous download for the client_helpers-x.x.x.zip file.

13.	Use the SVN export facility to create an export of https://indicia.googlecode.com/svn/drupal/modules/iform/trunk/iform into a local temporary folder.

14.	Zip the exported folder and name it iform-x.x.x.zip.

15.	Upload the zip file to the download page and set the labels to Featured and OpSys-All. Deprecate the previous version of this file.

16.	Review the changes at http://code.google.com/p/indicia/source/list. Write a list of the key changes and post this onto the forum with a note that the new version is ready.
