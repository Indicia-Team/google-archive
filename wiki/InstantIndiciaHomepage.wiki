#summary Summary of the Instant Indicia Homepage feature

= Homepage =

Homepage is an Instant Indicia feature which provides a replacement homepage for your site, with a column containing news stories and a column containing recently uploaded photos. 

Homepage is just a starting point for your website's home page and you can use the ideas it introduces to change the home page layout and add new columns and panels of your own choice. To do this, you will need some experience of the [http://drupal.org/project/panels Drupal Panels] module. Panels can seem a bit tricky at first and it is outside the scope of the Indicia Wiki to cover this module, but there are many resources available online including screencasts and other tutorials. It is well worth the effort though because it unlocks the possibility of creating just about any page layout you might want on your site.

The page layout used on the home page can be used by selecting _Site Building >> Pages >> List_ from the Drupal admin menu, then clicking edit by the Home Page custom page.
