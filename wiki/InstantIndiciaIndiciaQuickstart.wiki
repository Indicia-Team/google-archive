#summary Summary of the Indicia Quickstart feature

= Indicia Quickstart =

Indicia Quickstart is a feature provided with Instant Indicia that is enabled by default and should normally be left enabled. This feature is designed to provide a set of 'baseline' facilities that are available on all Instant Indicia sites. 

It performs the following tasks:

 # Creates menu links for register, login, logout and my account. When logged out, the login and register links are visible. When logged in, the logout and my account links are visible.
 # Creates roles called _admin user_ and _site editor_ and grants appropriate permissions to each. 
 # Declares permissions called _online recording_ and _indicia data admin_ which other features can associate with tasks that have controlled access. For example, any features that provide an online recording facility should restrict access to the online recording permission.
 # Disables Drupal 'add comment' links from appearing in abbreviated lists of content.
