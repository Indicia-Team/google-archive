#summary An introduction to the Indicia project.

= Introduction =

Welcome to the Indicia Wiki, where you will find information, documentation and tutorials on this project. Indicia is the online biological recording toolkit developed as part of the [www.OPALexplorenature.org OPAL] project.

== Online Recording ==

So, what do we mean by online biological recording? At least for our purposes, we are talking about a website that lets users contribute their wildlife observations, or _records_, to a database. The project is entirely focused on data capture rather than subsequent analysis. For example, the mapping and reporting facilities in Indicia are targeted at making the websites more interesting for users, so they come back and contribute more records. 

== Who will use Indicia? ==

There are 3 types of user predicted for Indicia. Firstly, the people who contribute wildlife observations. This includes anyone from members of the general public or schoolchildren through to professional surveyors and scheme members.

The next set of users are the people who will host the websites used for data capture. These include national recording schemes, local record centres and wildlife charities. Fundamentally, these are organisations that want to build up their store of biodiversity information by making it simpler to contribute wildlife observations.

Finally there is the team of people who provide the core services required by an online recording website. Things like managing the lists of species that are available to record, storing the actual data that is captured and so forth.

== What is Indicia? ==

Firstly, what it is not. Indicia is not an off the shelf solution for online recording. Rather, it is a toolkit that makes the development of online recording websites simpler. A bit like Google Maps, in that there is a programmer’s interface which makes it simple to drop rich mapping functionality into your website, Indicia provides a set of services, tools and examples that can be dropped into a website to provide rich online recording functionality. Of course there will be example sites developed using Indicia which can be used to build new sites, but Indicia ultimately gives website designers the power to do what they want, just quicker and more reliably than if they started from scratch.

== Who is developing Indicia? ==

In its initial phase, Indicia’s development is being led by Biodiverse IT, is funded by the [www.OPALexplorenature.org OPAL] project and managed by the [http://www.ceh.ac.uk/ Centre for Ecology and Hydrology] (CEH). The project is Open Source, which means you can have the code for free, and has a high level of community involvement.

== When will it be ready? ==

The initial development of the project is set to run from November 2008 to February 2009, by which time a working “core” should be available for testing and early adoption.
