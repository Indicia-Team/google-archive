#summary Overview of installing the Joomla component

= Introduction =

This page explains how to install the Joomla Indicia component. Before starting, you should have access to a working Indicia server, plus a working installation of Joomla version 1.5.9 or later. At the moment you will also need a SubVersion client to access the code, though it will be packaged for download when ready. Ideally you should also have a GeoServer installation, configured with a feature type that exposes the data you will be capturing using the component. This data should include the taxa_taxon_list_id attribute so that the Joomla component can filter the displayed map by species.


= Details =
 # First, using your SubVersion client checkout the code from http://indicia.googlecode.com/svn/joomla/trunk/ into a new folder.
 # Now, copy the files from this folder directly into the root of your Joomla installation, placing the files inside existing folders as required.
 # From the files you downloaded, find the file administrator\components\com_indicia\indicia.xml and zip it to create a new file. Place this file in a temporary location on your disk.
 # In the Joomla administrator interface, select Extensions then Install/Uninstall from the menu. In the section Upload Package File, select your zip file and upload it.

The component is now installed. You can now [JoomlaConfiguration add the component to a menu item] so that a data entry page is accessible from your website.
