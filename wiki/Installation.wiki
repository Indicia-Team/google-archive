= Installation =

This guide is a quick summary of the steps required to install the Indicia Warehouse. You don't have to install the Warehouse to use Indicia if you are happy to use a Warehouse provided by another organisation. Note that installing the Warehouse involves setting up a web server since Indicia is a web, rather than a desktop, application. Therefore installation is a little more involved than the typical desktop application.

Note that if you are installing Indicia onto a hosted shared server, the chances are you will not have the full privileges required to setup the PostGIS database and PHP settings (if required). It may be helpful to ask your web host to perform the steps *Install PostgreSQL and PostGIS* and to check that the pgsql and cURL extensions are enabled for PHP as described in the section *Install PHP and a Web Server*.

A [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDr449BaH8U video tutorial of the Warehouse installation process] is available.

== Install PostgreSQL and PostGIS ==

First, install the PostgreSQL database server and the PostGIS extension for your operating system. For downloads and more information see [http://www.postgresql.org/] and [http://postgis.refractions.net/]. Note that if you are installing on Windows, version 8.3 and higher of PostgreSQL allow you to install PostGIS by using the Stack Builder tool included with PostgreSQL.

If you are installing PostgreSQL on a Linux server then you may find the following links extremely useful: 
  * [http://www.postgresonline.com/journal/archives/203-postgresql90-yum.html An almost idiot's guide to Install PostgreSQL 9.0 with Yum] 
  * [http://www.postgresonline.com/journal/archives/204-postgis15-install-yum.html An Almost Idiot's Guide to Installing PostGIS 1.5 on PostgreSQL 9.0 via Yum].

Next, create a PostGIS database on your server. You don't need to put any content in the database yet. There are several possible ways of doing this, but the easiest is to run pgAdmin III which is supplied in the PostgreSQL installation. In the tree on the left, there is a node called Servers, and underneath that is your server. Double click this and enter your password if it asks you. Now, expand the Databases node, select "postgres", then click the icon in the toolbar that looks like a document titled SQL with a pencil. Now, in the editor that appears, enter the following SQL script and click the green run button in the toolbar, which creates a PostGIS database called *indicia*.
{{{
CREATE DATABASE indicia TEMPLATE=template_postgis;
}}}
A word of warning. After choosing the 'Server' from the left hand pane within pgAdmin, a list of existing databases will be displayed for that server, including the 'template_postgis'. One of these databases will be opened by default - unfortunately for a blank installation this will be the 'template_postgis' database as there are no others. In order for the above statement to work, this must not be active (i.e. it must have a red cross over its icon) - pgAdmin will complain that another user (in this case itself) has the template database open. In this case, the problem may be circumvented by creating a blank database with no template (e.g. called 'X'), shutting down pgAdmin, and then restarting it. On reopening the relevant server, the dummy database should be active, and the 'template_postgis' one not. The above statement should now be able to be run without issue. The dummy database may then be deleted.

You can use the postgres super-user account to run Indicia if you like, which is the easiest but least secure method. Please do *NOT* use the super-user account for anything other than development purposes. Assuming you want to create your own user to run Indicia, run the following script to create the user and add it to the database, changing the username, password and database name as required:
{{{
CREATE USER indicia_user WITH PASSWORD 'indicia';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE indicia TO indicia_user;
}}}

Now, connect your query tool to the new indicia database by using the drop down in the toolbar then selecting <new connection>, and run the following script which allows the Indicia user just enough rights to access the PostGIS functionality:
{{{
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON TABLE geometry_columns TO indicia_user;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON TABLE spatial_ref_sys TO indicia_user;
GRANT EXECUTE ON FUNCTION st_astext(geometry) TO indicia_user;
GRANT EXECUTE ON FUNCTION st_geomfromtext(text, integer) TO indicia_user;
GRANT EXECUTE ON FUNCTION st_transform(geometry, integer) TO indicia_user;
}}}

== Install PHP and a web server ==

If you are installing on Windows, then you will typically want to use IIS (Internet Information Services) or Apache as your web server software. For other operating systems we recommend the Apache web server. This tutorial is written on the assumption that you are using Apache, though the steps will mostly be the same (except with different folder locations) for IIS.

There are many tutorials on the web on how to install PHP and a webserver such as Apache. PHP version 5.2 or higher is required. For example, the following guide explains installation of PHP, Apache and MySQL on Windows: [http://www.php-mysql-tutorial.com/install-apache-php-mysql.php]. MySQL is not required by the Indicia Warehouse. Another alternative is to install a ready made 'stack' with a set of predefined components all packaged into one install kit. An example is [http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp.html XAMPP] though note that version 1.7.4 removed several modules from previous versions making Indicia installation more difficult. You can download version 1.7.3 for Windows from [http://sourceforge.net/projects/xampp/files/XAMPP%20Windows/1.7.3/].

After installing PHP, edit your php.ini file and uncomment the following two lines by removing the semi-colon at the start. This enables the pgsql module required for PHP to access the PostgreSQL database, and the cURL module which the demonstration site pages use to access the web services. After you've changed and saved the file, restart your Apache web server.
{{{
extension=php_curl.dll
extension=php_pgsql.dll
}}}

Once you have done this, it's a good idea to check that the cURL and pgsql libraries have been installed successfully for PHP. You can do this by creating a file called phpinfo.php in the root html directory of your webserver, and editing it with a text editor. If you installed XAMPP, then you will find this folder under XAMPP/htdocs. Enter the following text into the file and save it:
{{{
<?php echo phpinfo(); ?>
}}}

Now go to a web browser, and enter the root of your webserver followed by phpinfo.php (e.g
http://localhost/phpinfo.php). The page you see should detail your PHP configuration, and if you look down the page you should see that the cURL and pgsql libraries are loaded.

_Tip: If you have installed PHP 5.2.6 and the pgsql library won't load, this may be because of a bug in this release of PHP making it incompatible with the version of PostgreSQL you have installed. To fix this, you will need to replace the file php_pgsql.dll in your PHP installation with the version from the PHP 5.2.5 download, and also replace the file libpq.dll from your PostgreSQL install folder with the one from this download.
Another problem can occur when loading the pgsql libraries for PHP on a Windows Apache server, because of the paths not being correct. For more information on this issue see [http://stackoverflow.com/questions/551734/php-not-loading-php-pgsql-dll-on-windows.]_

== Get the Warehouse code ==

First, create yourself a folder inside your Apache root (htdocs) folder, for example htdocs\indicia. Now, download the [http://code.google.com/p/indicia/downloads/list Indicia Warehouse code] and unzip it. Inside the zip file you will find a file called Indicia. Copy the contents of this folder into the folder you have just created on your webserver. Please note, if you are re-installing the Indicia Warehouse for whatever reason, always remove the contents of the previous installation from the folder completely before copying over the new files. Simply copying the new files on top of an existing installation does not work for reinstallations.

If you are running on a hosted server, it may be easiest to download and unzip the code into a local folder then use an FTP tool to upload it into a folder created on your web server account.

== Run the Setup ==

The Setup procedure will automatically start if you access the index.php file in the root of the website. So, just enter this into your web browser, for example http://localhost/indicia/index.php, and load the page. This should display the Indicia Setup Check page, which with any luck will show the following information:

http://indicia.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/setup_check.png

Each of the tasks that the Indicia Warehouse has identified still needs your attention are listed on this page in a warning box. Assuming that you have enabled the cUrl and PostgreSQL PHP extensions earlier in this guide and that an appropriate version of PHP is installed (at least 5.2), then the things you will need to attend to are as follows:

===Directory Access===

If your server is a production server then you should ensure that each folder has the required permissions, and no more. This section of the setup check gives you some pointers to the permission problems that currently exist, listing the folders that it has tested which have correct permissions as well as the ones which don't. In our case, the reports and trigger templates folders are writeable but should be readonly. Once you have corrected them you can refresh the page to check that it has worked. 

If you are installing a server for development or private purposes then it is safe to ignore the fact that the reports and trigger templates folders are writeable. Click the Acknowledge button and confirm that you are happy to ignore this on the next screen to allow you to proceed with the installation.

===Demo configuration===

Click the Configure Demo Pages button, then you will be presented with the Demo Configuration page:

http://indicia.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/setup_demo.png

This page allows you to provide a link to a [http://geoserver.org GeoServer] installation on your server which can provide access to the spatial data in your Warehouse. If you don't have one, don't worry as this is only required for some distribution mapping functionality and can be added later. 

In addition, this page allows you to specify API keys for various web services used by the Indicia demo pages. If you don't specify them now, they can be entered later by editing the file client_helpers/helper_config.php. Also note that these settings are only for the demo pages on the warehouse, so it is safe to save this page with blank settings if you are not going to use the demo pages.

===Email Configuration===

Click the Configure email button, then you will be presented with the Email Configuration page:

http://indicia.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/setup_email.png

On this page, you need to provide the information Indicia needs to connect to a mail server in order to send forgotten password reminder emails. If you are running a development server or don't need this functionality, you can click the Skip email configuration button. Here are some notes on the setup options:

*Outgoing mail server* is the address you use to send mail out to from this account. This would be the smtp address given by your email provider, e.g. smtp.domain.com.

*Username for email connection* is the username used by your email application to connect to your email account. 

*Password for email connection* is the password used by your email application to connect to your email account. 

You should normall be able to leave the other settings as they are, though you can configure the port if using a non-standard port, as well as the title used and server name given in forgotten password emails. Note that if you want to change these settings at a later date, they are stored in the Warehouse's email configuration file in application/config/email.php.

===Database Configuration===

Click the Configure database button, then you will be presented with the Database Configuration page:

http://indicia.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/setup_db.png

Specify the name of the database you have created, plus the username and password of the user you created earlier. Additionally, there is an option to enter a second username and password for the user that reports will be run with. For ultimate security this should be a separate user account with access to select from appropriate tables only, though for a test installation it is fine to use the same username and password as the main user. You will also be asked to enter a schema name - typically you can enter "indicia" as the schema name but if you need to run more than one Indicia warehouse on a single PostgreSQL database you can use another name.

The Host and Port can be left at their default settings if PostgreSQL is running on the local machine on the default port.

Once done, just click the Submit button. It will take a few seconds to return to the Setup Check page now because the database itself is being installed and prepared for use.

Once you have done all the setup tasks required, you will see the following:

http://indicia.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/setup_complete.png

If everything has worked, clicking the button on the message will take you to the login page for the Indicia Warehouse Module. The initial login username is admin, with no password, but after logging in you will be immediately taken to the page that requests you to change your password and setup other details of the admin login.

Finally, after setting up the login account you will be redirected to the Home page, where you will see a message indicating that you need to upgrade the database to the latest version. Click the upgrade button to complete the installation process.

That's it!

== Next Steps ==

=== Demonstration Pages ===
In order to get the demonstration pages up and running now that you have installed the Indicia Warehouse, take a look at [DemoSiteModuleInstallation Installing the demonstration site module].

=== Security ===
To secure your Indicia installation, you need to prevent directory access to each of the folders. In addition you should block all access to the application\cache folder since this is where requested authentication details from data entry pages are stored. To do this on Apache, assuming that .htaccess is supported on your server and mod_rewrite is installed, rename the file example.htaccess in the root of the indicia installation folder to just .htaccess.

== Optimisation ===
If you are able to set the default search path for your indicia user that accesses the database, then it is possible to implement a performance improvement. To do this, run the following script replacing indicia_user with your username:
{{{
ALTER USER indicia_user SET search_path = indicia, public, pg_catalog;
}}}

Now, open the indicia.php file in the application/config folder using a text editor. Find the entry called apply_schema and set it to false. You can create the entry if it is not already present:
{{{
$config['apply_schema']=false;
}}}
