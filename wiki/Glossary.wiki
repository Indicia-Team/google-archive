|| Term || Description ||
|| Kohana || The PHP development framework that the core of Indicia is built using. For more information, see [http://kohanaphp.com/home]. ||
|| MVC || Model View Controller. This is a "design pattern" - a standard way of approaching a coding problem. In this case it is a method of delineating code into the model (i.e. the data and how it inter-relates), the view (the information you see on the screen), and the controller (the code that handles all the interactions in the system). Indicia is structured using MVC which helps to ensure everything stays nicely structured.
|| Taxon || Any item in a taxonomic hierarchy, including everything from a kingdom (typically at the top of the hierarchy) down to species or even sub-species level. ||
