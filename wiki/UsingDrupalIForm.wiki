#summary How to setup the Drupal IForm module

= Introduction =

This tutorial guides you through the steps required to setup the IForm module for integrating Indicia's prebuilt form library into Drupal.

Before starting, you should have a working installation of both Drupal and Indicia, or access to a working Warehouse. In addition you will need a tool that can decompress a tar.gz tarball file such as [http://www.7-zip.org/download.html 7-Zip].

= Steps =

In the Drupal installation folder, navigate to sites/all. Create a modules folder in this directory unless it is already present.

Download the IForm module (accessible from the featured downloads section at [http://code.google.com/p/indicia/]). Unzip this archive and copy the resulting  iform folder into this modules folder so your folder structure now looks like:

http://indicia.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/drupal_folder_layout.png

Download the following modules:
  * Jquery_update (version which supports jQuery 1.3, for example 6.x-2.x-dev version) from http://drupal.org/project/jquery_update 
  * Jquery_ui (I downloaded the 6.x-1.3 version)

To extract the files from the archives you have downloaded, right click the downloaded tar.gz file then select 7-Zip->Open archive. Now, in 7-zip itself, right click the .tar file and select Open Inside. Now you can drag the folder you see into the sites/all/modules alongside the iform module.

The jquery_ui plugin also needs you to download the latest stable version of the jQuery UI. The downloads are on this page: http://code.google.com/p/jquery-ui/downloads/list. I chose 1.7.2. Unzip this file, then copy the folder inside it into your sites/all/modules/jquery_ui folder and rename it to jquery.ui.

Now you need to install the modules into Drupal. In the Drupal front-end, select Administer->Site building->Modules. Scroll down the list of modules and tick the Indicia forms module, jQuery UI and jQuery Update modules.

You also need to configure the Indicia "client helper". In your sites/modules/all/iform/client_helpers folder, create a file called helper_config.php and paste the following content into it, replacing the url in the first entry with your Indicia site, including the trailing slash:
<?php
class helper_config {
  static $base_url='http://www.mysite.com/indicia/';
  static $upload_path = './upload/';
  static $geoserver_url = '';
  static $geoplanet_api_key='';
  static $google_search_api_key='';
  static $google_api_key='';
  static $multimap_api_key='';
  static $flickr_api_key='';
  static $flickr_api_secret='';
}
?>
There is more information on the configuration settings in this file at http://code.google.com/p/indicia/wiki/SetupHelperConfig, but just the $base_url is enough for a minimal usage.

To create forms, you first need to set up at least a website, survey and species list in the Indicia Warehouse. Then, use the Create content link in Drupal and select Indicia Forms as the type of content.

You will be asked for a page title and the usual Drupal page configuration, but also to select an Indicia Form. Start by selecting the Basic 1 - species, date, place, survey and comment form. When you select this, the Drupal page will load the parameters you need to fill in before using the form, which vary depending on the form you selected. In this case, specify the following parameters:
*Species Control Type* - what type of data entry control to use for picking a species.
*Website ID* - the ID of your website registration in Indicia.
*Website Password* - the Password of your website registration in Indicia.
*Species List ID* - the ID of the species list on the Warehouse which the users are allowed pick from.
*Preferred Species Only* - whether to limit the selection of species to preferred names.
*Use Tabbed Interface* - tick this box to split the entry form up into tabs.
*Redirect to page after successful data entry* - leave blank for now, but can be used to specify a page to go to after successfully entering a record.

That's it, save this and your Drupal page is ready to go.
