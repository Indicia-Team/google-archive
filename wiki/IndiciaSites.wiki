The following is a list of some of the online recording websites that have been built using Indicia.

The Recording Invasive Species Counts (RISC) project is a way to find out more and to contribute to our understanding of the distribution and ecology of ten invasive non-native species.  It is co-ordinated by the NBN and BRC (part of the Centre for Ecology & Hydrology), in partnership with recording schemes for the animals and plants.  The project is funded by Defra. Indicia online recording forms are used to allow recording of 10 selected invasive species.
