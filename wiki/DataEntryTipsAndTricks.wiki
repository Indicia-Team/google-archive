== Disable the mouse wheel on the map picker ==

The mouse wheel is used as a zoom control on an OpenLayers map by default. However, it is possible to disable this functionality. Simply insert the following code into your page below the dump_javascript command:
{{{
<script type="text/javascript">
	jQuery(document).ready(function() {
 		jQuery.each(map.controls, function(i,control) {
			if (control instanceof OpenLayers.Control.Navigation) {
				control.disableZoomWheel();
			}
		});
	});
</script>
}}}

Because there is a map global variable that holds the OpenLayers map object, this technique can be used to take full control over the behaviour of the map if required.

If you are using the data_entry_helper::map_panel this behaviour can also be achieved through the options
{{{
echo data_entry_helper::map_panel(array(
    'scroll_wheel_zoom'=>false,
));
}}}
