== Disable the mouse wheel on the map picker ==

The mouse wheel is used as a zoom control on an OpenLayers map by default. However, it is possible to disable this functionality. Simply insert the following code into your page below the dump_javascript command:
{{{
<script type="text/javascript">
	jQuery(document).ready(function() {
 		jQuery.each(map.controls, function(i,control) {
			if (control instanceof OpenLayers.Control.Navigation) {
				control.disableZoomWheel();
			}
		});
	});
</script>
}}}

Because there is a map global variable that holds the OpenLayers map object, this technique can be used to take full control over the behaviour of the map if required.
