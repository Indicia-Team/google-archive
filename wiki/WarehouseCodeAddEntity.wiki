=Model View Controller code for the warehouse=

The Indicia warehouse uses [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model–view–controller MVC] (Model-View-Controller) to provide a consistent structure to the code. This is based on the MVC flavour provided by the [http://kohanaframework.org/ Kohana framework] but with several custom extensions. These articles assume you have a basic knowledge of PHP code and MVC. 

Each database entity has code defined in 3 files, the model, the view and the controller. In addition a database script is required that defines the table schema as well as, normally, 3 views for different usages of the table data.
