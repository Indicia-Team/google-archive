#summary Improving the loading performance for data entry pages

= Introduction =

This page lists some ideas for improving the performance of your data entry pages. Before starting, you should have a working Indicia data entry page, for example by following the [TutorialBuildingBasicPage Building a basic PHP data entry page] tutorial.

== Reducing database access by hard-coding controls ==
When you create a control on your web page which interacts with Indicia's data, this requires your website to issue a request to the Indicia Warehouse using a web service. Indicia then queries the warehouse and returns the results to you. An example might be a select box populated from a termlist such as DAFOR abundance codes. Although this is normally nearly instantaneous, when your web page has many controls, or when there are lots of users loading the pages simultaneously, this approach can slow things down. 

If your termlist's content is generally static, you may find it beneficial to load the web page, right click on the page and search for the HTML that was generated by your call to the data_entry_helper class. Then copy this to the clipboard and paste it into your PHP page replacing the call to the data_entry_helper. Alternatively just comment out the original PHP code so that you can regenerate the HTML snippet if the termlist content changes. Here's an example.
{{{
<?php echo data_entry_helper::checkbox_group(
  'smpAttr:5', 'termlists_term', 'term', 'id', $readAuth + array('termlist_id' => $config['places_termlist']), '<br />'
); ?>
}}}
becomes
{{{
<?php /* echo data_entry_helper::checkbox_group(
  'smpAttr:5', 'termlists_term', 'term', 'id', $readAuth + array('termlist_id' => $config['places_termlist']), '<br />'
); */ ?>
<span><input type='checkbox' id='smpAttr:5' name='smpAttr:5' value='13' />Garden</span><br />
<span><input type='checkbox' id='smpAttr:5' name='smpAttr:5' value='14' />Yard</span><br />
<span><input type='checkbox' id='smpAttr:5' name='smpAttr:5' value='15' />No outside space</span>
}}}
