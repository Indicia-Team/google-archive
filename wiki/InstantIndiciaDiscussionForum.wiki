#summary A summary of the Discussion Forum Instant Indicia feature.

= Discussion Forum =

The Discussion Forum feature provides a one-click solution to installing a discussion forum on your website. The forum itself is built using Drupal forum modules rather than Indicia but it sits naturally alongside Indicia online recording in many cases.

To use the forum your users will need to register with the site first. The forum is divided into a number of folders, each containing any number of forum topics created by the users. You need to configure the list of folders before the forum is used. The installation includes a folder called Miscellaneous to get you started. 

To edit the list of folders, you need to add terms to the relevant _taxonomy_ (here used in the loose rather than biological sense). To do this, select _Content Management >> Taxonomy >> list_ from the menu. Click _list terms_ for the Forums vocabulary. You can now use the _Add term_ link near the top, or edit the existing Miscellaneous entry to configure the list of forum folders.
