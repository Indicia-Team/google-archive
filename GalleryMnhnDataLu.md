## MNHNL Data Portal ##

The MNHNL Data Portal (http://data.mnhn.lu) provides a focal point for citizen science biodiversity projects in Luxembourg. Currently several "Take Part" projects are running as well as the COBIMO project for monitoring bird populations based on transect walking. In the near future the site will be enhanced to feature online recording for museum collaborators.

The Take Part surveys use the mnhnl\_citizen\_science\_1 prebuilt form and the COBIMO project uses the mnhnl\_bird\_transect\_walks form. The site is multi-lingual and makes full use of Indicia's internationalisation facilities. It also uses a custom _tile cache_ layer for detailed maps of Luxembourg, and a custom place search service integrated with the data entry helper's georeference\_lookup control.
